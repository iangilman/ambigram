The user interface I have in mind for this one-dimensional swipe interface is that swiping left or right anywhere on the screen goes backward or forward in the movie from wherever it currently is.

On finger down a translucent glow appear around the touch point, with arrows pointing left and right that suggest moving your finger left or right.

And when the movie first appears, the glow+arrows appear on the screen for a few seconds, then fades out, to tell the user that this functionality is available. How's that sound?

Default state of the movie is that it autoplays at some default speed, and either loops, or ping pongs (forward to end, then backwards back to the beginning, repeat).
